This is source distribution the developemnt version of AxY FTP 
(formerly known as WXftp)

AxY FTP is not in a public domain. Please read LICENSE for details.


INSALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

You may build AxY FTP with either Motif 1.2/2.0/2.1 or GTK+ 1.0/1.2 interface.
Lesstif is also supported.

./configure 
make
make install (or make install-strip)

Name of the executable is "axyftp".

You may want to run "./configure --help" first to learn about all available
options. One of the most important are:
 --with-gui=GUI where GUI is either motif or gtk. By default, configure
                script first searches for Motif installation and, if not
		found, for GTK. 
 --with-help=DIR  where DIR is a directory you want to have help files
		   installed into.

Please not that if you are building Motif version, CDE DtWidget library is
needed. Pretty workable clone is supplied with the distribution in case you
don't have one installed. Also, XmAxy library containing Notebook and enhanced
List Motif-based widgets is also supplied. Libraries are not installed by
default. Use "./configure --enable-install-dt --enable-install-xmaxy" to
install them.

Also, you may find various AxY FTP logo icons in XPM format in icons/
subdirectory.

Good luck!
