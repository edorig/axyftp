Name changed to AxY FTP.
Converted to autoconf/automake.

XbaeMatrix is not longer used. Much lighter and faster XmAxyList (though not
as featurefull) is used instead. XmAxy library is supplied with AxY FTP
distribution.

clone is also supplied,
Fixed handling of profiles for both interfaces.

connected to does not support passive ones. Pretty transparent for the user.

this kind of of firewall.
