<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<p>
Current release of AxY FTP is supposed to have quite a few problems.
Here are some of them that I am aware of:<br>
<ul>
<li>"Cancel" button does not work reliably.
<li>Some sites appear without directory listing.
<li>Some firewalls are not supported
<li>Directory listing appears unsorted.
<li>VMS-style directory listing is not supported
</ul>
</p>
<p> Please report the problems you encounter to 
<a href="mailto:alexy@edgarmail.com">
Alexander Yukhimets</a>, the author of AxY FTP.
