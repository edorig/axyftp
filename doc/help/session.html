<h2>Session Window</h2>

<p>
Session window appears when you click "connect" button. It consists of
a lower bar with "OK","Cancel","Save", and "Help" buttons and a Notebook-
like structure with several pages. This version has three pages labelled 
<a href="#general">"General"</a>, <a href="#startup">"Startup"</a>, and
<a href="#advanced">"Advanced"</a>.
</p>
<UL> 
<li> <b>OK</b> button makes session window disappear and attempt to connect
to the site using the data displayed on the pages of the notebook.
<li> <b>Cancel</b> button just makes session window disappear.
<li> <b>Save</b> button saves changes to the selected or new session.
<li> <b>Help</b> button invokes <a href="help.html">on-line help</a>.
</ul>

<li><b>Profile Name</b> drop-down list<br>

<a name="startup">
<h3>"Startup" page</h3>
<p>
This page contains information on the immediate actions of the program upon
successful login to the remote site. 
</p>
<p>
First, FTP commands in the "Initial command" text field are sent to the 
remote server. Separate multiple commands with ';'. An example of this field
could be:<br>
<tt>SITE umask 022;SITE chmod 766 /logs/error.log</tt><br>
Do not put extra spaces, FTP protocol is very sensitive about it!
<p>

<p>
Second, the program changes to the remote directory specified in "Initial
remote directory" field, and then to local directory specified in "Initial
local directory" field. Remote and local masks are set to the values
specified in the "Remote File Mask" and "Local File Mask" fields.
Only after that the directory listings of both local and remote directories are
updated.
</P>
<p>When using automatic reconnect feature of the program by answering "Yes"
to the "Connection lost. Reconnect?" question, only the commands in the
"Initial Command" field are sent to the server. File masks and current
directories will remain the same as they were before losing connection.
</p>

<h3>"Advanced" page</h3>
<p>
This page currently contains only one text field: <b>Remote Host Port</b>.<br>
Default is 21 and it should stay this way unless you know it should be
changed.
