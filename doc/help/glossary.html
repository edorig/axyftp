<DT>FTP
<DD>File Transfer Protocol. Defined in RFC 959.

<DT>FTP Client
<DD>Program that connects to the FTP server, sends requests that follow
FTP protocol to that FTP server, and interprets the responses received.

<DT>FTP Server
<DD>Program, usually running in a background, that waits for connection from
FTP client and then serve the client by responding to requests received from
the client side.

<DT>Local Site
<DD>Linux box you are running FTP client from. Generally may differ from the
host that displays the program window.

<DT>Remote Site
<DD>The site, FTP server is running on that you are connected to. May very
well be on the same host as a Local Site.

<DT>Control Connection
<DD>Connection between FTP client and FTP server used to send and receive
requests and responses.

<DT>Data Connection
<DD>Connection usually established between FTP client and FTP server by
request from the Client. Used to transfer "data" rather than
requests/responses. An example of "data" would be directory listing or contents
of the file being transfered.

<DT>Passive Transfer
<DD>One of the ways to establish Data Connection. Client side requests the
Server to accept Data Connection, receives information on what address to
connect to, and then establishes Data Connection by connecting to the server.
Usually the only way to go if you are behind the firewall.

<DT>Firewall
<DD>A host that connects your local network to the global Internet.
May impose some restrictions on type of the Internet services allowed to pass
through.
