<h2>Using Help System</h2>

<p>In order to be able to use on-line help system of AxY FTP you should have
either Netscape or lynx installed. Another requirement is actually having
help pages installed into /usr/local/share/axyftp/help/. 
In the future there will be more flexibility in both help files locations and
the choice of the browser.
Help will also become context-sensitive some day.
</p>

<p>When you click on any "Help" button within AxY FTP and have Netscape
already running, the help page will be displayed in a browser window.
</p>
<h4>Make sure "netscape" executable is in some directory of your $PATH</h4>
<p>If Netscape is not running, the program will attempt to start it.
</p>
<p>If the program fails to find "netscape" on your system, it will start
xterm with "lynx" displaying help page in it. If that fails, there is nothing
it can do at the moment. On-line help will be unavailable.
</p>

<p> I plan to add more flexibility of the help viewers soon</p>
