<H2>Local and Remote Panels</h2>

<P>
The most information and control packed area of AxY FTP is local and remote
system panels containing <a href="#listing">detailed directory listing</a>, 
<a href="#name">current directory name</a>, 
and <a href="#column">vertical column of per-site controls</a>.
</P>

<a name="listing">
<h3>Directory Listing</h3>
<P>
Each row in the listing corresponds to a file (or directory) entry on either
local or remote site. There are five columns of information for each entry:
<UL>
<li> Graphical representation of entry type:<br>
<table border="0">
<tr><th><img src="folder.gif" alt="Folder icon"></th><td>directory</td></tr>
<tr><th><img src="up.gif" alt="Folder with Up Arrow icon"></th>
<td>upper level directory</td></tr>
<tr><th><img src="link.gif" alt="Document with Right Arrow icon"></th>
<td>symbolic link</td></tr>
<tr><th><img src="doc.gif" alt="Document icon"></th><td>"normal" file</td></tr>
</table>
More granular file type distinction is possible in future releases<br>
<li> File name
<li> Last modification date in the form YYYYMMDD
<li> Last modification time in 24-hour hh:mm format
<li> File size in bytes
</UL>
</P>
<p>
You may resize the columns.<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Motif version:</i><br>
Position pointer on the column edge and drag it with <tt>Shift</tt> key and 
<b>middle (second)</b> mouse button 
pressed. Make sure the pointer is <b>NOT</b> within labels area, but inside 
the listing window.<br>
<li><i>GTK+ version:</i><br>
Position pointer on the column edge within labels area and drag it with
<b>left (first)</b> mouse button pressed.<br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You may select entries by clicking on the row of interest with left mouse
button. It is also possible to select multiple entries with clicking or
dragging the pointer with either <tt>Shift</tt> or <tt>Ctrl</tt> key pressed.
</p>
<p> Double-click on a directory entry to change to it.
</p>
<p>There are no sorting capabilities of directory listing in the current 
version of the program.
</p>

<a name="name">
<h3>Directory name box</h3>
<p>
The area with the name of the current directory is displayed is located on top
of the directory listing. 
</p>
<p>
You may click on the arrow right to the name to access the history list.
Current directory always appears selected in this list. Selecting any other
entry will make the program to change to the directory you selected.
</p>
<p>You may directly edit the text filed with directory name by first clicking
on it with left mouse button. Pressing <tt>Enter</tt> key will make the
program to change to the directory you entered. If you misspelled the
directory name or if it was not possible to change to it for any other reason,
text in the directory name field is still the one you entered and is NOT a
valid name of the directory being displayed. History list, however, has the
correct name of the current directory selected. You may pull the history list
down and click on selected entry to restore correct directory name in the
text field.
</P>

<a name="column">
<h3>Column of controls</h3>
<p>
Main functionality of AxY FTP is provided through these columns of local and
remote controls. Each column consists of the following:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="#chgdir">ChgDir</a>
 <li><a href="#mkdir">MkDir</a>
 <li><a href="#mask">Mask entry field</a>
 <li><a href="#view">View</a>
 <li><a href="#exec">Exec</a>
 <li><a href="#rename">Rename</a>
 <li><a href="#delete">Delete</a>
 <li><a href="#refresh">Refresh</a>
 <li><a href="#dirinfo">DirInfo</a>
</ul>
</p>
<UL>
<a name="chgdir">
<li><b>ChgDir</b> button<br>
   Select some entry in directory listing (directory preferably) and click
   this button to change to the selected directory entry. <br>
<a name="mkdir">
<li><b>MkDir</b> button<br>
   Click this button and you will be prompted with a little dialog window
   to enter directory name you wish to create. Press <tt>Enter</tt> or click
   "OK" to actually perform the operation.<br>
<a name="mask">
<li><b>Mask</b> text entry field<br>
   Enter some mask using normal shell wild cards and press <tt>Enter</tt> for
   immediate effect. An example would be "*.c" to display only C source
   code files or ".*" to display only "hidden" entries. ".* *" mask should
   force to display all entries present in current directory. Current
   directory (.) and upper level directory (..) entries will be present in any
   case.<br>
   Note that not all remote sites support this feature.<br>
<a name="view">
<li><b>View</b> button<br>
   Select some entry in directory listing (text file preferably) and click
   this button to make file contents displayed. <br>
   <p>
   Following rules are used to select the viewer:<br>
   Internal viewer is used for the remote file.<br>
   For local file AxY FTP attempts to start the viewer specified by $XEDITOR
   environment variable (or "gvim" if not set). If fails, the program attempts
   to start xterm and execute a viewer specified by $EDITOR environment
   variable in it. If $EDITOR is not set, "vi" editor is executed in xterm 
   window.
   </p>
   Much more flexibility in possible local and remote viewers will be present 
   in future releases of AxY FTP.<br>
<a name="exec">
<li><b>Exec</b> button<br>
   Click this button to be prompted for the command to be executed on either
   local system in a subshell or on a remote system using 'SITE' command.
   A good example of the command would be <tt>"umask&nbsp;022"</tt> or 
   <tt>"chmod&nbsp;0755&nbsp;filename"</tt>. Directory listing is NOT
   updated after the command is executed, use "Refresh" to force the
   update.<br>
<a name="rename">
<li><b>Rename</b> button<br>
   Select some entry in directory listing and click on this button to be prompted
   for a new name of the selected entry. Press <tt>Enter</tt> or click "OK"
   to perform the operation.<br>
<a name="delete">
<li><b>Delete</b> button<br>
   Select some entry in directory listing and click this button.
   You will be prompted to confirm the delete operation. Clicking "OK"
   will perform the operation. Only "normal" files, symbolic links and
   <em>empty</em> directories can be deleted with this command unless
   <em>Recursive deletions</em> <a href="options.html#display">option</a>
   is checked.<br>
<a name="refresh">
<li><b>Refresh</b> button<br>
   Forces update of the current directory name and directory listing.<br>
<a name="dirinfo">
<li><b>DirInfo</b> button<br>
   Displays AxY FTP internal viewer window with even more detailed directory
   listing similar to the output of <tt>"ls&nbsp;-l"</tt><br>
