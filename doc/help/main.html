<a name="selector">
<h3>Transfer type selector</h3>
<p>
Selector consists of three radio buttons labelled "ASCII","Binary", and
"Auto". Default position is "Binary". If the remote host you are transferring
files to/from is also a UNIX-like system, use "Binary" mode even for text files,
it just be a little faster to transfer. "Auto" mode is currently equivalent to
"Binary", it will try to guess the correct mode by file extension in
future releases.
</p>

<a name="arrows">
<h3>Download/Upload Arrow Buttons</h3>
<p>
When connected to some remote host, select several remote or local entries
and click on "-&gt;" ("&lt;-") button to perform upload (download).
Both multiple recursive <b>downloads</b> and <b>uploads</b> are implemented.
</p>
<p>
Progress window will appear displaying the file name being transfered,
the size of the file in bytes, percentage transfered, bytes transfered,
transfer rate (in kbytes/sec), elapsed time of the transfer and estimated
time to complete the transfer. You may use "Cancel" button of the progress
window to interrupt the file transfer.
Progress bar will appear for large files only or will not appear at all if
you specified an appropriate <a href="options.html#display">option</a>.
</p>
<p>
When file about to get transfered already exists on the other side, a dialog 
appears asking for the action to perform. You may chose <b>Overwrite</b> to
start transfer anew, <b>Resume</b> to continue interrupted download, or
<b>Skip</b> to leave the file alone.
