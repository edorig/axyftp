This is an attempt to create a small widget library compatible with standard
libDtWidget from commercial CDE distribution. 

This is release 1.4.0 of the library.

Please let me know what you think about it.

Buiding instructions:

./configure
make
make install

For full list of options, run
./configure --help


Contents:

Dt:		Mostly compatible with CDE libDtWidget library sources.
        	Relevant changes from several places (included in 
		distribution) are merged into the original Ileaf, Inc. 
		source. Only CDE-compatible modifications made here.
		Can be built as a "Multi-Thread Safe" with Motif 2.1.

orig:		"Original" (version 1.1) distribution of ComboBox and 
		SpinButton widgets by Ileaf, Inc.

moz:		Modified ComboBox from the Mozilla (www.mozilla.org) project.
moz-clean:	The same as above, with exaclty the same changes to the
		original source, but cosmetically edited to resemble the 
		Ileaf source as much as possible in order to minimize diff 
		size (to be able easily see relevant changes).

cwikla:		ComboBox code, modified by John L. Cwikla (cwikla@wolfram.com)
cwikla-clean:	The same as above, edited to minimize diff.

jra:		JERRY ADAIR <adair@iglou.com>'s take on modifying SpinButton
		from the original Ileaf, Inc. widget distribution.
		Even the name of the widget was changed in CDE, so it is
		not included in the main library here. Needs much more work.
